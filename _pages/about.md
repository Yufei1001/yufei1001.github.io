Hi, I'm **Yufei Jin** 🐧. I also go by Yvette.

I am a MEng student in Computer Engineering at UCLA. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Technology at Fudan University.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Monica Lam on developing LLM + formal-language agentic systems for retrieval, aiming for mismatch-free, transparent behavior in high-stakes, safety-critical settings. I also work with Prof. Yang Zhang at UCLA on human-centered LLM applications that protect users’ privacy without compromising convenience, and with Prof. Youngjoong Kwon at Emory on sparse-view human reconstruction for telehealth scenarios.

Broadly, my research interests lie in developing trustworthy AI systems that produce logically precise, well-grounded, verifiable, comprehensive, and unbiased outputs that genuinely benefit society and support scientific discovery. I am particularly interested in making AI behave reliably, accurately, and robustly in high-stakes tasks so that humans can safely and confidently cooperate with these systems.
